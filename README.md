# ZeroMQ
ZeroMQ Test

Let's write a simple example in Python that leverages ZeroMQ using a message bus between two containers. <br>
This example uses the PUB-SUB pattern. PUB containers publish messages, and SUB containers subscribe to those messages.

ZeroMQ is a lightweight, high-performance messaging library designed for distributed computing and message passing.<br>
It is an open-source messaging library that provides efficient communication between processes and systems in various languages.<br>
ZeroMQ supports different messaging patterns, enabling efficient data exchange between multiple processes or systems.<br>

Key features and concepts include:<br><br>

1. **Lightweight and Fast:** ZeroMQ is highly lightweight and offers high performance. It minimizes messaging overhead and enables fast data transfer.<br>

2. **Support for Various Patterns:** It supports various messaging patterns such as PUB-SUB, REQ-REP, PUSH-PULL, allowing users to effectively exchange messages in different scenarios.<br>

3. **Multi-platform Support:** ZeroMQ can be used on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br>

4. **Protocol-Agnostic:** ZeroMQ is not tied to a specific protocol and supports multiple protocols. It commonly uses TCP, IPC (Inter-Process Communication), and in-process communication.<br>

5. **Socket Types:** ZeroMQ sockets come in different types, such as PUB, SUB, REQ, REP, PUSH, and PULL. This diversity allows users to choose the appropriate socket type for different situations.<br>

ZeroMQ finds applications in distributed systems, message queues, real-time data processing, and more. Known for its flexibility and high performance, it has been adopted in various projects and systems.
